The majority of my recent work has been focused on React (and sometimes Vue) SPA development in both Javascript and Typescript.

I am very strong in React; well-versed in Hooks & Context, component structure and interaction, and the ecosystem around it (Redux, Sagas, Formik, Gatsby, Routing, etc).

Recent major projects:

* TD Ameritrade - internal Order Management UI for brokers & call center associates (Angular)
* Mutual of Omaha - rewrite of main customer service portal for Customers & call center associates (React)
* US Air Force - greenfield dev of prototype Weather Forecast generator UI (React)
* Chewy.com - rewrite of Checkout page (Vue), rewrite of Shopping Cart page (React)
* WoodmenLife - rewrite of external marketing website to React & Headless CMS (Contentful) static site generation (SSG) using Gatsby
