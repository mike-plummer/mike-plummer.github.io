I started out as an enterprise Java developer. Lots of Spring-suite experience between legacy
Spring Framework and, more recently, Sprint Boot and Spring cloud packages. ReST service development,
unit testing with Mockito, data source interactions using Hibernate/JPA and spring-data, a bit of
Kafka, etc. I've also dabbled in Kotlin from time to time, speaking on the subject at several conferences
and user groups in addition to doing enterprise development in the language.

Major projects I've done JVM work on:

* Lockheed Martin - assorted DoD enterprise Java (US Air Force mission planning, USMC battle management)
* TD Ameritrade - new Order Management System for trades
* Chewy.com - Kafka-based event pub/sub flow for PromoCode generation/redemption, Kotlin work on existing Storefront website codebase
