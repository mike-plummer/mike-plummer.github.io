Thoughout my development career I've used a variety of unit testing tools to validate business logic and component interactions, including Mocha/Chai, Jest, `testing-library/*` libraries.

I worked for over a year on the Cypress.io E2E + Component Testing tool, giving me extensive expertise in automated testing.
