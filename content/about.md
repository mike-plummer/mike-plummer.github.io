Hello!

### _A little bit about myself_

I'm a full-stack developer, dabbling in a bit of everything. Mostly Java and JVM languages like Java, Kotlin, and Groovy with a side of front-end development in React and Angular. Graduate of Iowa State and Penn State with about a decade of hobby and professional development under my belt.

After a few years out west I've returned to my roots in the midwest US and now work as a Principal Technologist at [Object Partners](https://www.objectpartners.com) in Omaha, Nebraska.
