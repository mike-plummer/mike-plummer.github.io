Hello!

**A little bit about myself**

I'm a full-stack developer, dabbling in a bit of everything. Mostly Java and JVM-based languages like Groovy with a side of Angular.js. Graduate of Iowa State University (Go Cyclones!) and Penn State (I don't want to talk about it) with about a decade of hobby and professional development under my belt.

After a few years out west I've returned to my roots by coming back to the midwest US and now work as a Senior Consultant at [Object Partners](https://www.objectpartners.com) in Omaha, Nebraska.
