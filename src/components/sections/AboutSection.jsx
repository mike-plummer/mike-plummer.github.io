      <strong>A little bit about myself</strong>
      <p>
        I'm a full-stack developer, dabbling in a bit of everything. Mostly front-end development in React and
        Angular with a side of Java and JVM languages like Kotlin and Groovy. Graduate of Iowa State and Penn State
        with about a decade of hobby and professional development under my belt.

      <p>
        After a few years out west Iâ€™ve returned to my roots in the midwest US and now work as a Principal
        Technologist at <a href="https://objectpartners.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">Object Partners</a> in Dallas, Texas.
